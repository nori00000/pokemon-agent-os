Do not plan movement into plain black space; use visible floor tiles as walkable space unless occupied by an object or wall. Exception: if a black/dark tile is shaped like a doorway, carpet, threshold, stairs, mat, path marker, or other movement-guiding feature, it may be worth approaching or testing once as a possible transition/exit.",
